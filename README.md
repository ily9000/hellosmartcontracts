# Have you wondered how you can add a smart contract to the Ethereum Blockchain?

To begin we will first add our contract to the Ropsten test network. Ropsten test network has the same protocol as the etherum network.

1. Have access to a node. A node runs the software to verify your transactions and keeps a record of all transactions in the blockchain. For this exercise, I used quicknode so that I didn't need to set my own up.
2. Go to the Ropsten faucet: https://faucet.ropsten.be/ and setup a wallet with some fake ETH.
3. npm install HardHat
4. In the contracts folder write a simple solidity contract
5. In the scripts folder, write a deploy script.
